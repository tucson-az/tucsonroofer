For commercial roofs, they provide roof maintenance, roofing repair, roof coatings, and roof inspections. The residential roofing materials they can provide include ceramic or concrete tiles; various roofing shingles such as asphalt, wood, or other composite shingles; flat roof using bitumen, PVC, or built-up materials.</p><p>Ceramic or concrete tiles offer a number of benefits for residential properties. They have a very attractive appearance for many people. They are reminiscent of Mediterranean style homes and they are durable and long lasting. They can withstand heat and salt water air and they can drain a lot of water fast, which means that they are beneficial in areas that get a lot of heavy rain.</p><p>Meanwhile, asphalt shingles are affordable and easy to work with. They are also quite durable, especially with asphalt shingles made from a fiberglass base and asphalt and mineral granules. These asphalt shingles often have a 20 to 30 year warranty.</p><p>The commercial roofing materials they can handle include spray polyurethane foam (SPF), single-ply membrane, metal, tar and gravel, and shingle. SPF is sprayed as a liquid so that it expands into a foam and creates a solid layer across an existing roof. This can last for more than 50 years and it can withstand any climate. SPF is known for providing substantial energy savings because it can provide air, thermal, and vapor insulation. Meanwhile, single-ply membrane roofing is one of the most common types of commercial roofing materials.</p><p>Built-up roofing (BUR) systems are often used for both residential and commercial applications. These are commonly known as &ldquo;tar and gravel&rdquo; roofs and are frequently used for flat roofs. A BUR system is installed by alternating layers of reinforced fabric and modified bitumen. The last layer is stone or rock to protect the underlying layers from extreme heat and cold, UV rays, and wind damage. It should be noted that each type of roof has its pros and cons and property owners may want to discuss these with DC Roofing professionals to find out the most appropriate roofing material for their property.</p><p>Homeowners and other property owners in Tucson who are in need of roofing services may want to check out the news of the DC Roofing of Arizona website, or contact them on the telephone or via email. They are open from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, from Monday to Saturday.</p><!-- xxxxx  END Content Block --><!-- xxxxx  Start Accordion -->					                        <div role="tablist" id="accordion-2">                            <div class="card" style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0);">                                <div class="card-header" role="tab" style="background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0);">                                    <h5 class="mb-0"><a data-toggle="collapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="accordion-2 .item-1" href="div#accordion-2 .item-1" style="color:rgb(187,200,215);">Service Area</a></h5>                                </div>                                <div class="collapse item-1" role="tabpanel" data-parent="#accordion-2">                                    <div class="card-body"><!-- xxxxx  Start Accordion CONTENT Block -->                                          <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d431855.5893518497!2d-110.848354!3d32.2615316!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0xbcf27ef93d33a9f6!2sDC%20Roofing%20of%20Arizona!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1595199464831!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" aria-hidden="false" tabindex="0"></iframe>										  										  <iframe src="https://roofer-tucson.glitch.me/" style="border:0px #ffffff none;" name="Tucson Roofer Serving Greater Tucson" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="400px" width="600px" allowfullscreen></iframe>										  										  <iframe src="https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/acAv6VxR/noheader" style="border:0px #ffffff none;" name="Tips from a Tucson Roofer" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="400px" width="400px" allowfullscreen></iframe>										  <!-- xxxxx  END Accordion CONTENT Block -->										                                    </div>                                </div>                            </div>                        </div>                        <div role="tablist" id="accordion-1"></div>                    </div>                </div>            </div>        </section>    </main>    <div class="footer-dark">        <footer>            <div class="container">                <div class="row">                    <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3 col-lg-10 item">					<!-- xxxxx  Footer Info (tag line, phone, email etc) -->     						<h3>Get in Touch</h3>                        <ul>                            <li><i class="icon ion-android-radio-button-on" style="margin-right:5px;color:#bc5e1e;"></i>Call Us!
